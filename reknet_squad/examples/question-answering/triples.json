	"Tesla exhibited a pre-atomic understanding of physics in his writings; he disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge (he believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity).:249 Tesla believed that atoms are immutable\u2014they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive \"ether\" that transmitted electrical energy.
